# Queen, Knight, and King Placement Problem

Place 8 queens, 8 knights, and 4 kings on an 8x8 chessboard such that:

1. No queen threatens another queen (no two queens in the same row, column, or diagonal)
2. No knight threatens any queen or another knight
3. No knight is placed on one of the 8 neighboring fields of another knight
4. No king is threatened by any other piece (queen, knight, or another king)
5. Two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal if and only if a knight is positioned between them, blocking the threat
