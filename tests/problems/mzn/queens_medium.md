# Extended Queens Problem (6x6)

Solve the following extended version of the 6-Queens problem:

1. Place 6 queens on a 6x6 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
2. Additionally, place 5 knights on the board such that:
   - No knight threatens any queen
   - No knight is threatened by any queen
   - No two knights threaten each other

Remember that queens attack along rows, columns, and diagonals, while knights move in an L-shape (2 squares in one direction and then 1 square perpendicular to that direction).
