Solve the 8x8 queens problem.

Now try to add eight knights such that they are not threatening one of the queens or another knight. They are also not allowed to be on one of the 8 neighbouring fields of another knight (you may also change the positions of the queens as long as they do not threaten each other). This opens new possibilities because now two queens could theoretically be in the same row, column or diagonal as long as a knight is between them.

Finally, try to add four kings such that they are not threatened by any other piece (you may as well adapt your previous model).
