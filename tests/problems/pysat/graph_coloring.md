# Graph Coloring Problem

Can you solve this graph coloring problem using PySAT?

We have a graph with the following vertices:
- A, B, C, D, E

And the following edges:
- A is connected to B, C, and E
- B is connected to A and C
- C is connected to A, B, D, and E
- D is connected to C and E
- E is connected to A, C, and D

Can you color this graph using only 3 colors (Red, Green, Blue) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color?
