# Minimum Vertex Cover Problem

Find a minimum vertex cover of the Petersen graph using MaxSAT optimization. A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find a vertex cover with the minimum number of vertices.

## Task

Use MaxSAT optimization to find a minimum vertex cover of the Petersen graph.

Report the vertices in your minimum cover and verify that it covers all edges.
