Consider an integer array with 8 empty slots that needs to satisfy these conditions:

1. The array must be sorted in ascending order
2. Each value must be between 1 and 15 (inclusive)
3. The number 7 must appear exactly once in the array
4. The sum of all elements must equal 60
5. No two adjacent elements can both be even numbers

Find a valid array that meets all these requirements.
