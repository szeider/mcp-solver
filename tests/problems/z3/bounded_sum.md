# Bounded Sum Problem

Find an assignment of integers to variables a, b, c, d, and e that:

1. Each variable must be between 1 and 10 inclusive
2. All variables must have different values
3. The sum of all five variables must be exactly 30
4. The product of a and b must be less than 25
5. The product of c, d, and e must be greater than 100

Provide a solution that satisfies all these constraints, or prove that no solution exists.
