# Solution Correctness Verification

## Task

You are given a problem description, a PySAT encoding, and a solution. Verify the correctness of the solution.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **For satisfiable solutions**: Verify that all constraints in the problem description are satisfied. Answer *correct* if satisfied, otherwise *incorrect*.
- **For unsatisfiable solutions**: Verify that all clauses produced by teh encoding are actually required by the problem statement or are valid symmetry breaking constraints. Answer *correct* if valid, otherwise *incorrect*.

  Note that "unsatisfiable" is a perfectly fine result. So if all constraints added to the model are valid representations of the problem requirements,  then your verdict should be *correct*.

- **For no solution/timeout/unverifiable cases**: Answer *unknown*.

## Output Format

After your detailed analysis, provide your verdict using simple XML tags.

IMPORTANT: Your answer MUST follow this structure:
1. First provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning
2. Analyze each clause in detail
3. End with a clear conclusion statement: "The solution is correct." or "The solution is incorrect."
4. Finally, add exactly ONE of these verdict tags on a new line:
   <verdict>correct</verdict>
   <verdict>incorrect</verdict>
   <verdict>unknown</verdict>

For example:
```
[Your detailed analysis here]

After checking all clauses, I can confirm that each one is satisfied by the provided solution values.

The solution is correct.

<verdict>correct</verdict>
```

The verdict must be EXACTLY one of: "correct", "incorrect", or "unknown" - nothing else.

IMPORTANT: Before finalizing your response, always check that:
1. Your explanation ends with a clear conclusion statement
2. The verdict tag matches your conclusion exactly 
3. If your explanation concludes "The solution is correct", then use <verdict>correct</verdict>
4. If your explanation concludes "The solution is incorrect", then use <verdict>incorrect</verdict>
5. If you cannot determine correctness or establish incorrectness, use <verdict>unknown</verdict>
