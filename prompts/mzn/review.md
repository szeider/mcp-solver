# Solution Correctness Verification

## Task

You are given a problem description, a MiniZinc model, and a solution. Verify the correctness of the solution.

## Verification Process

Follow these steps carefully:

1. Create a structured table of the solution values:
   - For each decision variable, record its value
   - For array variables, list each index and its corresponding value
   - Present this table at the beginning of your explanation

2. For each constraint:
   - State the constraint precisely
   - Extract the relevant variable values from your table
   - Show your evaluation process step-by-step
   - Conclude whether the constraint is satisfied or violated

3. If you identify a violation:
   - Double-check by re-extracting the exact values from the solution
   - Explicitly show how these values violate the constraint
   - Include the relevant indices and their values to avoid indexing errors

4. Before finalizing your verdict:
   - Re-verify any reported violations
   - Ensure you haven't misread or misinterpreted array indices or values

## Evaluation Criteria

- **For satisfiable solutions**: Verify that all constraints in the problem description are satisfied. Answer *correct* if satisfied, otherwise *incorrect*. You do not need to verify optimality - only check if the solution satisfies all constraints.

  Present your constraint verification in a structured format:
  - Constraint: [State the constraint]
  - Values: [List relevant variable values]
  - Evaluation: [Show calculation or reasoning]
  - Result: [Satisfied/Violated]

- **For unsatisfiable solutions**: Verify that all constraints in the MiniZinc model are actually required by the problem statement or are valid symmetry breaking constraints. Answer *correct* if valid, otherwise *incorrect*.

  Check constraint by constraint using the same structured format.

- **For no solution/timeout/unverifiable cases**: Answer *unknown*.

## Output Format

After your detailed analysis, provide your verdict using simple XML tags.

IMPORTANT: Your answer MUST follow this structure:
1. First provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning
2. Analyze each constraint in detail
3. End with a clear conclusion statement: "The solution is correct." or "The solution is incorrect."
4. Finally, add exactly ONE of these verdict tags on a new line:
   <verdict>correct</verdict>
   <verdict>incorrect</verdict>
   <verdict>unknown</verdict>

For example:
```
[Your detailed analysis here]

After checking all constraints, I can confirm that each one is satisfied by the provided solution values.

The solution is correct.

<verdict>correct</verdict>
```

The verdict must be EXACTLY one of: "correct", "incorrect", or "unknown" - nothing else.

IMPORTANT: Before finalizing your response, always check that:
1. Your explanation ends with a clear conclusion statement
2. The verdict tag matches your conclusion exactly 
3. If your explanation concludes "The solution is correct", then use <verdict>correct</verdict>
4. If your explanation concludes "The solution is incorrect", then use <verdict>incorrect</verdict>
5. If you cannot determine correctness, use <verdict>unknown</verdict>
