A university needs to schedule 8 courses across 4 time slots on 3 days (Mon/Wed/Fri). Each course needs 2 sessions per week. Constraints: 1. Three professors with specific course assignments: • Smith: AI, ML, Networks • Jones: Databases, Security • Brown: Physics, Chemistry, Biology 2. Professors can’t teach overlapping sessions 3. Each course needs a specific lab room: • 2 CS labs and 1 science lab available • CS courses need CS labs • Science courses need science lab 4. Student groups have required course combinations: • CS majors: AI+ML+Databases • Security track: Networks+Security • Pre-med: Physics+Chemistry+Biology 5. No student should have class conflicts



Let me formulate this scheduling problem.





```
{}
Valid: Model is valid
```



```
{}
{'status': 'SAT', 'solution': Solution(schedule=[[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1]], [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1]], [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]], [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1]]], _checker=''), 'solve_time': 0.001}
```

Let me translate the solution into a readable schedule:

Monday:

- No classes scheduled

Wednesday:

- Slots 3-4: AI, Physics

Friday:

- Slots 1-2: Networks, Databases, Chemistry
- Slots 3-4: ML, Security, Biology

All constraints are satisfied:

1. Each course has 2 sessions
2. No professor has overlapping sessions
3. Lab capacity respected (max 2 CS, 1 science concurrent)
4. No conflicts for student groups
