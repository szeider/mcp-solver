## Casting

This is based on an  example by George Johnson (NYT, July 13, 1999).

**User**

> Suppose that a theatrical director feels obligated to cast either his ingenue, Actress Alvarez, or his nephew, Actor Cohen, in a production. But Miss Alvarez won't be in a play with Mr. Cohen (her former lover), and she demands that the cast include her new flame, Actor Davenport. The producer, with her own favors to repay, insists that Actor Branislavsky have a part. But Mr. Branislavsky won't be in any play with Miss Alvarez or Mr. Davenport. Can the director cast the play?
