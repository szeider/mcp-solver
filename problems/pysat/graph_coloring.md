# Graph Coloring Problem

Color the vertices of the following graph using just 3 colors (Red, Green, Blue) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

The graph has 5 vertices (A, B, C, D, E) with the following edges:
- A is connected to B, C, and E
- B is connected to A and C
- C is connected to A, B, D, and E
- D is connected to C and E
- E is connected to A, C, and D

Is it possible to color this graph with only 3 colors? If so, find a valid coloring assignment.
